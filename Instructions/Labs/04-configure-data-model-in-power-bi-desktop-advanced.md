# **Model Data in Power BI Desktop, Part 2**

**The estimated time to complete the lab is 45 minutes**

In this lab you will create a many-to-many relationship between the **Salesperson** table and the **Sales** table. You will also enforce row-level security to ensure that a salesperson can only analyze sales data for their assigned region(s).

In this lab you learn how to:

- Configure many-to-many relationships

- Enforce row-level security

### **Lab story**

### **Task 2: Create a many-to-many relationship**

In this task you will create a many-to-many relationship between the **Salesperson** table and the **Sales** table.

1. In Power BI Desktop, in Report view, in the **Fields** pane, check the follow two fields to create a table visual:

	- Salesperson | Salesperson

	- Sales | Sales

	*The labs use a shorthand notation to reference a field. It will look like this: **Salesperson | Salesperson** . In this example, **Salesperson**  is the table name and **Salesperson**  is the field name.*

	![Picture 1](Linked_image_Files/04-configure-data-model-in-power-bi-desktop-advanced_image9.png)

	*The table displays sales made by each salesperson. However, there’s another relationship between salespeople and sales. Some salespeople belong to one, two, or possibly more sales regions. In addition, sales regions can have multiple salespeople assigned to them.*

	*From a performance management perspective, a salesperson’s sales (based on their assigned territories) need to be analyzed and compared with sales targets. You’ll create relationships to support this analysis in the next exercise.*

2. Notice that Michael Blythe has sold almost $9 million.

3. Switch to Model view.

	![Picture 10](Linked_image_Files/04-configure-data-model-in-power-bi-desktop-advanced_image10.png)

4. Drag the **SalespersonRegion** table to position it between the **Region** and **Salesperson** tables.

5. Use the drag-and-drop technique to create the following two model relationships:

	- **Salesperson | EmployeeKey** to **SalespersonRegion | EmployeeKey**

	- **Region | SalesTerritoryKey** to **SalespersonRegion | SalesTerritoryKey**

	*The **SalespersonRegion** table can be considered to be a bridging table.*

6. Switch to Report view, and then notice that the visual has not updated—the sales result for Michael Blythe has not changed.

7. Switch back to Model view, and then follow the relationship filter directions (arrowhead) from the **Salesperson** table.

	*Consider that the **Salesperson** table filters the **Sales** table. It also filters the **SalespersonRegion** table, but it does not continue by propagating filters to the **Region** table (the arrowhead is pointing the wrong direction).*

	![Picture 380](Linked_image_Files/04-configure-data-model-in-power-bi-desktop-advanced_image11.png)

8. To edit the relationship between the **Region** and **SalespersonRegion** tables, double-click the relationship.

9. In the **Edit Relationship** window, in the **Cross Filter Direction** dropdown list, select **Both**.

10. Check the **Apply Security Filter in Both Directions** checkbox.

	*This setting will ensure that bi-directional filtering is applied when row-level security is enforced. You’ll configure a security role in the next exercise.*

	![Picture 381](Linked_image_Files/04-configure-data-model-in-power-bi-desktop-advanced_image12.png)

11. Click **OK**.

	![Picture 335](Linked_image_Files/04-configure-data-model-in-power-bi-desktop-advanced_image13.png)

12. Notice that the relationship has a double arrowhead.

	![Picture 382](Linked_image_Files/04-configure-data-model-in-power-bi-desktop-advanced_image14.png)

13. Switch to Report view, and then notice that the sales values have still not changed.

	*The issue now relates to the fact that there are two possible filter propagation paths between the **Salesperson** and **Sales** tables. This ambiguity is internally resolved, based on a “least number of tables” assessment. To be clear, you shouldn’t design models with this type of ambiguity—the issue will be addressed in part later in this lab, and by the completion of the **Create DAX Calculations in Power BI Desktop, Part 1** lab.*

14. Switch to Model view.

15. To force filter propagation via the bridging table, edit (double-click) the relationship between the **Salesperson** and **Sales** tables.

16. In the **Edit Relationship** window, uncheck the **Make This Relationship Active** checkbox.

	![Picture 383](Linked_image_Files/04-configure-data-model-in-power-bi-desktop-advanced_image15.png)

17. Click **OK**.

	![Picture 5696](Linked_image_Files/04-configure-data-model-in-power-bi-desktop-advanced_image16.png)

	*The filter propagation will now follow the only active path.*

18. In the diagram, notice that the inactive relationship is represented by a dashed line.

	![Picture 5697](Linked_image_Files/04-configure-data-model-in-power-bi-desktop-advanced_image17.png)

19. Switch to Report view, and then notice that the sales for Michael Blythe is now nearly $22 million.

	![Picture 5698](Linked_image_Files/04-configure-data-model-in-power-bi-desktop-advanced_image18.png)

20. Notice also, that the sales for each salesperson—if added—would exceed the table total.

	*It’s a common observation of a many-to-many relationship due to the double, triple, etc. counting of regional sales results. Consider Brian Welcker, the second salesperson listed. His sales amount equals the total sales amount. It’s the correct result simply due to the fact the he’s the Director of Sales; his sales are measured by the sales of all regions.*

	*While the many-to-many relationship is now working, it’s now not possible to analyze sales made by a salesperson (because the relationship is inactive). You’ll be able to reactive the relationship when you introduce a calculated table that to represent salesperson for performance analysis (of their regions) in the **Create DAX Calculations in Power BI Desktop, Part 1** lab.*

21. Switch to Modeling view, and then in the diagram, select the **Salesperson** table.

22. In the **Properties** pane, in the **Name** box, replace the text with **Salesperson (Performance)**.

	*The renamed table now reflects its purpose: it’s used to report and analyze the performance of salespeople based on the sales of their assigned sales regions.*

### **Task 3: Relate the Targets table**

In this task you will create a relationship to the **Targets** table

1. Create a relationship from the **Salesperson (Performance) | EmployeeID** column and the **Targets | EmployeeID** column.

2. In Report view, add the **Targets | Target** field to the table visual.

3. Resize the table visual so all columns are visible.

	![Picture 5699](Linked_image_Files/04-configure-data-model-in-power-bi-desktop-advanced_image19.png)

	*It’s now possible to visualize sales and targets—but take care for two reasons. First, there’s no filter on a time period, and so targets also include future target amounts. Second, targets are not additive, and so the total should not be displayed. They can either disabled by formatting the visual or removed by using calculation logic. You’ll follow the second approach by creationg a target measure in the **Create DAX Calculations in Power BI Desktop, Part 2** lab that’ll return BLANK when more than one salesperson is filtered.*

## **Exercise 2: Enforce row-level security**

In this exercise you will enforce row-level security to ensure a salesperson can only ever see sales made in their assigned region(s).

### **Task 1: Enforce row-level security**

In this task you will enforce row-level security to ensure a salesperson can only see sales made in their assigned region(s).

1. Switch to Data view.

	![Picture 5701](Linked_image_Files/04-configure-data-model-in-power-bi-desktop-advanced_image20.png)

2. In the **Fields** pane, select the **Salesperson (Performance)** table.

3. Review the data, noticing that Michael Blythe (EmployeeKey 281) has a UPN value of: **michael-blythe@adventureworks.com**

	*Recall that Michael Blythe is assigned to three sales regions: US Northeast, US Central, and US Southeast.*

4. Switch to Report view.

5. On the **Modeling** ribbon tab, from inside the **Security** group, click **Manage Roles**.

	![Picture 5700](Linked_image_Files/04-configure-data-model-in-power-bi-desktop-advanced_image21.png)

6. In the **Manage Roles** window, click **Create**.

	![Picture 5702](Linked_image_Files/04-configure-data-model-in-power-bi-desktop-advanced_image22.png)

7. In the box, replace the selected text with the name of the role: **Salespeople**, and then press **Enter**.

	![Picture 5703](Linked_image_Files/04-configure-data-model-in-power-bi-desktop-advanced_image23.png)

8. To assign a filter, for the **Salesperson (Performance)** table, click the ellipsis (…) character, and then select **Add Filter | [UPN]**.

	![Picture 5704](Linked_image_Files/04-configure-data-model-in-power-bi-desktop-advanced_image24.png)

9. In the **Table Filter DAX Expression** box, modify the expression by replacing **“Value”** with **USERPRINCIPALNAME()**.

	![Picture 11](Linked_image_Files/04-configure-data-model-in-power-bi-desktop-advanced_image25.png)

	*USERPRINCIPALNAME() is a Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) function that returns the name of the authenticated user. It means that the **Salesperson (Performance)** table will filter by the User Principal Name (UPN) of the user querying the model.*

10. Click **Save**.

	![Picture 5706](Linked_image_Files/04-configure-data-model-in-power-bi-desktop-advanced_image26.png)

11. To test the security role, on the **Modeling** ribbon tab, from inside the **Security** group, click **View As**.

	![Picture 5708](Linked_image_Files/04-configure-data-model-in-power-bi-desktop-advanced_image27.png)

12. In the **View as Roles** window, check the **Other User** item, and then in the corresponding box, enter: **michael-blythe@adventureworks.com**

13. Check the **Salespeople** role.

	![Picture 5709](Linked_image_Files/04-configure-data-model-in-power-bi-desktop-advanced_image28.png)

	*This configuration results in using the **Salespeople** role and impersonating the user with your Michael Blythe’s name.*

14. Click **OK**.

	![Picture 5710](Linked_image_Files/04-configure-data-model-in-power-bi-desktop-advanced_image29.png)

15. Notice the yellow banner above the report page, describing the test security context.

	![Picture 13](Linked_image_Files/04-configure-data-model-in-power-bi-desktop-advanced_image30.png)

16. In the table visual, notice that only the salesperson **Michael Blythe** is listed.

	![Picture 5713](Linked_image_Files/04-configure-data-model-in-power-bi-desktop-advanced_image31.png)

17. To stop testing, at the right side of the yellow banner, click **Stop Viewing**.

	![Picture 5712](Linked_image_Files/04-configure-data-model-in-power-bi-desktop-advanced_image32.png)

	*When the Power BI Desktop file is published to the Power BI service, you’ll need to complete a post-publication task to map security principals to the **Salespeople** role. You won’t do that in this lab.*

18. To delete the role, on the **Modeling** ribbon tab, from inside the **Security** group, click **Manage Roles**.

	*You won’t work any further with row-level security in the labs.*

	![Picture 16](Linked_image_Files/04-configure-data-model-in-power-bi-desktop-advanced_image33.png)

19. In the **Manage Roles** window, click **Delete**.

	![Picture 17](Linked_image_Files/04-configure-data-model-in-power-bi-desktop-advanced_image34.png)

20. When prompted to confirm the deletion, click **Yes, Delete**.

21. Click **Save**.

	![Picture 18](Linked_image_Files/04-configure-data-model-in-power-bi-desktop-advanced_image35.png)

### **Task 2: Finish up**

In this task you will complete the lab.

1. Save the Power BI Desktop file.

2. If prompted to apply queries, click **Apply Later**.

3. If you intend to start the next lab, leave Power BI Desktop open.

	*You’ll enhance the data model with calculations using DAX in the **Create DAX Calculations in Power BI Desktop, Part 2** lab.*
