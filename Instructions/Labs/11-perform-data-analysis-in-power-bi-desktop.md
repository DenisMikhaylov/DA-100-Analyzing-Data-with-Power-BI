	![Picture 18](Linked_image_Files/10-perform-data-analysis-in-power-bi-desktop_image15.png)

	![Picture 75](Linked_image_Files/10-perform-data-analysis-in-power-bi-desktop_image16.png)

3. Add the following fields to the visual wells/areas:

	The labs use a shorthand notation to reference a field. It will look like this: **Reseller** **\|** **Business Type**. In this example, **Reseller** is the table name and **Business Type** is the field name.

	- Legend: **Reseller \| Business Type**

	- X Axis: **Sales \| Sales** 

	- Y Axis: **Sales \| Profit Margin**

	- Size: **Sales \| Quantity**

	- Play Axis: **Date \| Quarter**

	![Picture 39](Linked_image_Files/10-perform-data-analysis-in-power-bi-desktop_image17.png)

	*The chart can be animated when a field is added to the **Play Axis** well/area.*

4. In the **Filters** pane, add the **Product \| Category** field to the **Filters On This Page** well/area.

5. In the filter card, filter by **Bikes**.

	![Picture 40](Linked_image_Files/10-perform-data-analysis-in-power-bi-desktop_image18.png)

6. To animate the chart, at the bottom left corner, click **Play**.

	![Picture 41](Linked_image_Files/10-perform-data-analysis-in-power-bi-desktop_image19.png)

7. Watch the entire animation cycle from **FY2018 Q1** to **FY2020 Q4**.

	*The scatter chart allows understanding the measure values simultaneously: in this case, order quantity, sales revenue, and profit margin.*

	*Each bubble represents a reseller business type. Changes in the bubble size reflect increased or decreased order quantities. While horizontal movements represent increases/decreases in sales revenue, and vertical movements represent increases/decreases in profitability.*

8. When the animation stops, click one of the bubbles to reveal its tracking over time.

9. Hover the cursor over any bubble to reveal a tooltip describing the measure values for the reseller type at that point in time.

10. In the **Filters** pane, filter by **Clothing** only, and notice that it produces a very different result.

11. Save the Power BI Desktop file.

## **Exercise 3: Create a Forecast**

In this exercise you will create a forecast to determine possible future sales revenue.

### **Task 1: Create a forecast**

In this task you will create a forecast to determine possible future sales revenue.

1. Add a new page, and then rename the page to **Forecast**.

	![Picture 66](Linked_image_Files/10-perform-data-analysis-in-power-bi-desktop_image20.png)

2. Add a **Line Chart** visual to the report page, and then position and resize it so it fills the entire page.

	![Picture 19](Linked_image_Files/10-perform-data-analysis-in-power-bi-desktop_image21.png)

	![Picture 74](Linked_image_Files/10-perform-data-analysis-in-power-bi-desktop_image22.png)

  

3. Add the following fields to the visual wells/areas:

	- Axis: **Date \| Date**

	- Values: **Sales \| Sales** 

	![Picture 46](Linked_image_Files/10-perform-data-analysis-in-power-bi-desktop_image23.png)

4. In the **Filters** pane, add the **Date \| Year** field to the **Filters On This Page** well/area.

5. In the filter card, filter by two years: **FY2019** and **FY2020**.

	![Picture 47](Linked_image_Files/10-perform-data-analysis-in-power-bi-desktop_image24.png)

	*When forecasting over a time line, you will need at least two cycles (years) of data to produce an accurate and stable forecast.*

  

6. Add also the **Product \| Category** field to the **Filters On This Page** well/area, and filter by **Bikes**.

	![Picture 48](Linked_image_Files/10-perform-data-analysis-in-power-bi-desktop_image25.png)

7. To add a forecast, beneath the **Visualizations** pane, select the **Analytics** pane.

	![Picture 20](Linked_image_Files/10-perform-data-analysis-in-power-bi-desktop_image26.png)

8. Expand the **Forecast** section.

	![Picture 50](Linked_image_Files/10-perform-data-analysis-in-power-bi-desktop_image27.png)

	*If the **Forecast** section is not available, it’s probably because the visual hasn’t been correctly configured. Forecasting is only available when two conditions are met: the axis has a single field of type date, and there’s only one value field.*

9. Click **Add**.

	![Picture 51](Linked_image_Files/10-perform-data-analysis-in-power-bi-desktop_image28.png)

10. Configure the following forecast properties:

	- Forecast length: 1 month

	- Confidence interval: 80%

	- Seasonality: 365

11. Click **Apply**.

	![Picture 52](Linked_image_Files/10-perform-data-analysis-in-power-bi-desktop_image29.png)

12. In the line visual, notice that the forecast has extended one month beyond the history data.

	*The gray area represents the confidence. The wider the confidence, the less stable—and therefore the less accurate—the forecast is likely to be.*

	*When you know the length of the cycle, in this case annual, you should enter the seasonality points. Sometimes it could be weekly (7), or monthly (30).*

13. In the **Filters** pane, filter by **Clothing** only, and notice that it produces a different result.

14. Save the Power BI Desktop file.

## **Exercise 4: Work with a Decomposition Tree**

In this exercise you will create a decomposition tree to explore the relationships between reseller geography and profit margin.

### **Task 1: Work with a decomposition tree**

In this task you will create a decomposition tree to explore the relationships between reseller geography and profit margin.

1. Add a new page, and then rename the page to **Decomposition Tree**.

	![Picture 65](Linked_image_Files/10-perform-data-analysis-in-power-bi-desktop_image30.png)

2. On the **Insert** ribbon, from inside the **AI Visuals** group, click **Decomposition Tree**.

	*Tip: The AI visuals are also available in the **Visualizations** pane.*

	![Picture 54](Linked_image_Files/10-perform-data-analysis-in-power-bi-desktop_image31.png)

3. Position and resize the visual so it fills the entire page.

	![Picture 73](Linked_image_Files/10-perform-data-analysis-in-power-bi-desktop_image32.png)

4. Add the following fields to the visual wells/areas:

	- Analyze: **Sales \| Profit Margin**

	- Explain By: **Reseller \| Geography** (the entire hierarchy)

	![Picture 57](Linked_image_Files/10-perform-data-analysis-in-power-bi-desktop_image33.png)

5. In the **Filters** pane, add the **Date \| Year** field to the **Filters On This Page**, and set the filter to **FY2020**.

	![Picture 59](Linked_image_Files/10-perform-data-analysis-in-power-bi-desktop_image34.png)

6. In the decomposition tree visual, notice the root of the tree: **Profit Margin** at -0.94%

	![Picture 21](Linked_image_Files/10-perform-data-analysis-in-power-bi-desktop_image35.png)

7. Click the plus icon, and in the context menu, select **High Value**.

	![Picture 61](Linked_image_Files/10-perform-data-analysis-in-power-bi-desktop_image36.png)

8. Notice that the decomposition tree presents resellers, ordered from highest profit margin.

9. To remove the level, at the top of visual, beside the **Reseller** label, click **X**.

	![Picture 62](Linked_image_Files/10-perform-data-analysis-in-power-bi-desktop_image37.png)

10. Click the plus icon again, and then expand to the **Country-Region** level.

11. Expand from the **United States** to the **State-Province** level.

12. Use the down-arrow located at the bottom of the visual for **State-Province**, and then scroll to the lower profitable states.

13. Notice that **New York** state has negative profitability.

14. Expand from **New York** to the **Reseller** level.

15. Notice that it is easy to isolate root cause.

	![Picture 22](Linked_image_Files/10-perform-data-analysis-in-power-bi-desktop_image38.png)

	***United States** is not producing profit in **FY2020**. **New York** is one state that’s not achieving positive profit, and it’s due to four resellers paying less than standard costs for their goods.*

16. Save the Power BI Desktop file.

## **Exercise 5: Work with Key Influencers**

In this exercise you will use the Key Influencers AI visual to determine what influences profitability within reseller business types and geography.

### **Task 1: Work with key influencers**

In this task you will use the Key Influencers AI visual to determine what influences profitability within reseller business types and geography.

1. Add a new page, and then rename the page to **Key Influencers**.

2. On the **Insert** ribbon, from inside the **AI Visuals** group, click **Key Influencers**.

	*Tip: The AI visuals are also available in the **Visualizations** pane.*

	![Picture 71](Linked_image_Files/10-perform-data-analysis-in-power-bi-desktop_image40.png)

3. Position and resize the visual so it fills the entire page.

	![Picture 72](Linked_image_Files/10-perform-data-analysis-in-power-bi-desktop_image41.png)

4. Add the following fields to the visual wells:

	- Analyze: **Sales \| Profit Margin**

	- Explain By: **Reseller \| Business Type** and **Reseller \| Geography** (the entire hierarchy)

	- Expand By: **Sales \| Quantity**

	![Picture 3](Linked_image_Files/10-perform-data-analysis-in-power-bi-desktop_image42.png)

5. At the top-left of the visual, notice that **Key Influencers** is in focus, and the specific influence is set to understand what influences profit margin to increase.

	![Picture 76](Linked_image_Files/10-perform-data-analysis-in-power-bi-desktop_image43.png)

6. Review the result, which is that the city of **Bothell** is more likely to increase.

7. Modify the target to determine what influences profit margin to decrease.

	![Picture 77](Linked_image_Files/10-perform-data-analysis-in-power-bi-desktop_image44.png)

8. Review the result.

9. To detect segments, at the top-left, select **Top Segments**.

	![Picture 78](Linked_image_Files/10-perform-data-analysis-in-power-bi-desktop_image45.png)
