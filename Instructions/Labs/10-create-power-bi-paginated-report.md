# **Create a Power BI Paginated Report**

**The estimated time to complete the lab is 45 minutes**

In this lab you will use Power BI Report Builder to develop a pixel-perfect paginated report layout that sources data from the **AdventureWorksDW2020** SQL Server database. You will create a data source and dataset, and also configure a report parameter. The report layout will allow data to be rendered over multiple pages, and to be exported in PDF and other formats.

The final report will look like the following:

![Image of the completed Sales Order Report. It includes a title, subtitle details, the company logo, and a table of sales order lines.](Linked_image_Files/11-create-power-bi-paginated-report_image1.png)

- Use Power BI Report Builder

- Design a multi-page report layout

- Define a data source

- Define a dataset

- Create a report parameter

## **Exercise 2: Design the Report Layout**

In this exercise you will design the report layout, and explore the final report design.

### **Task 1: Configure the report header**

In this task you will configure the report header.

1. In the report designer, notice the default report layout, which consists of a body region and a report footer region.

	![C:\Users\PETERM~1\AppData\Local\Temp\SNAGHTML330700e8.PNG](Linked_image_Files/11-create-power-bi-paginated-report_image5.png)

	*The body contains a single textbox ready for a report title, and the report footer contains a single textbox describing the report execution time.*

	*The default design will render the report title once, in the body, on the first rendered page. However, you will now modify the report design by adding a report header region, and by moving the report title textbox into this region. This way, the report title will repeat on every page. You will also add an image of the company logo.*

1. To add a report header region, on the **Insert** ribbon tab, from inside the **Header &amp; Footer** group, click **Header**, and then select **Add Header**.

14. Click **Open**.

15. In the **Query** box, review the query, and be sure to scroll down to the bottom of the query text.

	*It is not important that you understand the details of the query statement. It has been designed to retrieve sales order line details. The WHERE clause includes a predicate to restrict the query result to a single sales order. The ORDER BY clause ensures the rows are returned by line number order.*

16. Notice the use of **@SalesOrderNumber** in the WHERE clause, which represents a query parameter.

	![Picture 3](Linked_image_Files/11-create-power-bi-paginated-report_image20.png)

	*A query parameter is a placeholder for a value that will be passed in at query execution time. You will configure a report parameter to prompt the report user for a single sales order number which will then be passed to the query parameter.*

17. Click **OK**.

18. In the **Report Data** pane, notice the addition of the **SalesOrder** dataset and its fields.

	![Picture 44](Linked_image_Files/11-create-power-bi-paginated-report_image21.png)

	*Fields are used to configure data regions in the report layout. They were derived from the dataset query columns.*

19. Save the report.

### **Task 3: Configure the report parameter**

In this task you will configure the report parameter with a default value.

1. In the **Report Data** pane, expand the **Parameters** folder to reveal the **SalesOrderNumber** report parameter.

	![Picture 107](Linked_image_Files/11-create-power-bi-paginated-report_image22.png)

	*The **SalesOrderNumber** report parameter was added automatically when the dataset was created. This is because the dataset query included the **@SalesOrderNumber** query parameter.*

2. To edit the report parameter, right-click the **SalesOrderNumber** report parameter, and then select **Parameter Properties**.

	![Picture 46](Linked_image_Files/11-create-power-bi-paginated-report_image23.png)

	*This sales order has 72 sales order lines, and so the data will render over many pages.*

24. To navigate to the second page of the report, on the **Run** ribbon tab, from inside the **Navigation** group, click **Next**.

25. On page 2, notice that the table header does not appear.

	*You will address this issue in the next task.*

26. Scroll to the bottom of the page, and then notice that the report footer displays only the execution time.

	*In the next task you will improve the footer text by appending the page number.*

### **Task 7: Finalize the report design**

In this task you will finalize the report design by ensuring multi-page reports render appropriately.

1. Switch to the design view.

2. To ensure the table header repeats on all pages, first select any textbox of the table.

3. In the **Grouping** pane (located along the bottom of the report designer), at the far right of the **Column Groups**, click the down-arrow, and then select **Advanced Mode**.

4. In the **Row Groups** section, select the first static group.

	![Picture 86](Linked_image_Files/11-create-power-bi-paginated-report_image63.png)

	*This selected the table header row.*

5. In the **Properties** pane, set the **Other \| RepeatOnNewPage** property to **True**.

	*This ensures that the first static group (representing the table header) will repeat on all pages.*

6. In the table footer region, right-click the **ExecutionTime** textbox, and then select **Expression**.

7. In the **Expression** window, in the expression box, append a space, followed by **&amp; " \| Page " &amp;**, to produce the following:


	**VB Script**
	```
	=Globals!ExecutionTime & " | Page " &
	```


8. Ensure that a space follows the last ampersand (&).

9. In the **Category** list, select **Built-in Fields**.

10. To inject the page number value into the expression, in the **Item** list, double-click **PageNumber**.

11. Verify that the complete expression reads as follows:

	![Picture 114](Linked_image_Files/11-create-power-bi-paginated-report_image66.png)

12. Click **OK**.

13. Drag the left side of the textbox to increase the width to the width of the report page.

	![Picture 104](Linked_image_Files/11-create-power-bi-paginated-report_image67.png)

	*The design of the report is now complete. Lastly, you will ensure that the page width is set to exactly six inches, and also remove the report parameter default value.*

14. To select the report body, right-click any table textbox, and then select **Select \| Body**.

	![C:\Users\PETERM~1\AppData\Local\Temp\SNAGHTML34507b38.PNG](Linked_image_Files/11-create-power-bi-paginated-report_image68.png)

	*As the table fills the entire report body, this technique must be used to select the report body.*

15. In the **Properties** pane, ensure that the **Position \| Size \| Width** property is set to **6**.

	*It is important the width is not greater than six inches, as rendering to print format would break the table up across multiple pages.*

16. In the **Report Data** pane, open the **SalesOrderNumber** report parameter properties.

17. On the **Default Values** page, select the **No Default Value** option.

	![Picture 98](Linked_image_Files/11-create-power-bi-paginated-report_image69.png)

18. Click **OK**.

19. Save the report.

### **Task 8: Explore the final report**

In this task you will view the report in print layout mode.

1. Preview the report.

2. In the **Sales Order Number** parameter box, enter the value with **51721**

3. On the **Run** ribbon tab, from inside the **Print** group, click **Print Layout**.

	![Picture 7](Linked_image_Files/11-create-power-bi-paginated-report_image70.png)

	*Print layout mode provides a preview of what the report will look like when printed to the strict page size.*

4. Navigate to pages 2 and 3.

	*In this lab you won’t publish the report. Paginated reports can only be rendered in the Power BI service when they are stored in a workspace on dedicated capacity, and when that capacity has the paginated reports workload enabled. These requirements do not exist for the class.*
